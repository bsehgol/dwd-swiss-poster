There was a billion tree initiative by KPK government to plant a billion trees in its fight against climate change. KPK area being highly susceptible to climate change and years of deforestation, the billion tree idea became a social movement where school children took a leading role in it. Th billion tree project was successfully completed in 2017. In 2018 a new agenda was set, with 10 billion trees to be planted this time around. 

Inspired from this movement to plant trees is an initiative announced this year at the World Economic Forum, called the 1 Trillion tree initiative, that has its own platform and community accessible throught this website 1t.org. 

Nonetheless this website is inadequate, and needs to be popularized with a great landing page. In Dynamic Web Development class we were tasked to make a swiss poster design inspired landing webpage and I took this as an opportunity to develop the landing page of a Web App that gamifies tree-plantation. 

You can view this webpage at https://bsehgol-dwd-swiss-poster.glitch.me/

Alternatively you may download the repo from github and run this webpage locally on your server. 

In order to develop this page, Flex-box, a CSS-wizardry tool was used. Flex-box makes life so much simpler where you can easily manage divs on the webpage to match the grid-layout you drew on Sketch (A Sketch file is also in dwd-swiss-poster repository that may be downloaded to see the sort of boxes I ended up creating using Flex-box. 

An app would follow.
